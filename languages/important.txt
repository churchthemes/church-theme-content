Do not add your own translations to this directory. They will be lost during plugin updates. The only .mo files that should be loaded from here are pre-made translations that come with the plugin (if any are included).

Store your translations at wp-content/languages/plugins/church-theme-content-$locale.mo
(e.g. church-theme-content-en_US.mo) to keep them safe from loss during updates.

Read https://churchthemes.com/go/translate-plugin for more information and please contact us if you would like to contribute your translation for other churches to use.
