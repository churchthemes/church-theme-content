== Description ==

The Church Content WordPress plugin provides an interface for managing sermons, events, people and locations. Please be aware that a **compatible theme is required** for presenting content from these church-centric post types in a tightly-integrated manner.

= Who this is for =

This plugin is intended for a very specific audience. If you are *not* one of the following then this plugin will not be useful to you.

* Users of [official themes](https://churchthemes.com) from ChurchThemes.com
* Users of [third-party themes](https://churchthemes.com/third-party-themes) made *specifically* for this plugin
* Theme developers improving data portability for church sites

= What it does =

It provides post types, taxonomies and fields for *sermons*, *events*, *people* and *locations* to be shown by a compatible church WordPress theme.

Experienced WordPress developers agree that functionality like this does not belong in themes since themes are intended only for controlling the appearance of a WordPress site. Content that users might expect to take with them if they switch themes should "live" in a plugin in order to [avoid theme lock-in](https://churchthemes.com/wordpress-theme-users-avoid-lock-in-effect/). Similarly, our approach is not to present content using the plugin since themes offer more control for that purpose. This is why a **compatible theme is required**.

See the [Plugin Details](https://churchthemes.com/plugins/church-content/) on ChurchThemes.com for a tour of features. Read the [User Guide](https://churchthemes.com/guides/user/plugins/church-content/) for instructions.
